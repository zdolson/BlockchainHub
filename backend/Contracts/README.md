## this is the smart contract directory: 
1. "new-boa" directory is where all of the smart contract and related dependencies are hosted <br />  
2. "testme" directory is the fucntional testing directory (under construction) <br />
    1. the reason why it's still under construction is because of the iterator.py in boa package has not been updated as of 5/1/18 which is required for dynamic storage
    2. Until then, it is manual testing from here on out
